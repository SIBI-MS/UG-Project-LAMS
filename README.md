# LAMS (Library Attendance Management System)

LAMS is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the process of monitoring and managing student attendance while providing insights into library usage patterns. Developed to meet the needs of educational institutions, LAMS offers a range of features aimed at improving attendance tracking, data analysis, and user management.

## Key Features

Each studentâ€™s ID card is equipped with an RFID tag, allowing for automated and efficient attendance recording as students enter the library.

2. **Data Analysis**: LAMS goes beyond basic attendance tracking by offering advanced data analysis tools. It helps educators identify trends, patterns, and areas of concern related to attendance, enabling timely interventions.

3. **Student User Management**: LAMS allows administrators to manage student profiles efficiently. It provides options for editing student details, ensuring up-to-date and accurate records.

4. **Library Usage Insights**: The system includes features to monitor library usage, helping institutions understand student behavior in the library. It can identify the most active library members and provide insights into library resource utilization.

5. **Live Membership Tracking**: LAMS offers real-time tracking of library members, making it easier to manage library access and resources effectively by providing information about current students inside the library.
